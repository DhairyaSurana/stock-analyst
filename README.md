# Stock Analyst 
(Currently under development)


A Python script that scans wsj.com for stock data. 
This script scrapes wsj.com pages based on the ticker value.

This program uses the pycurl library to scrape stock data.
The script is optimized via concurrency.

As of July 3rd, 2020, the script has only been tested with 7 stocks.

The overall goal of this project is to develop a program that
can return a list of stocks to invest in based on certain statistics.

The script DOES NOT automatically buy or sell stocks.

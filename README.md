# Stock Analyst 
(Currently under development)


A Python script that scans wsj.com for stock data. 
This script scrapes wsj.com pages based on tickers present
in a text file.

This program uses the pycurl library to scrape stock data.
The script is optimized via concurrency.

The overall goal of this project is to develop a program that
can return a list of stocks to invest in based on certain statistics.

The script DOES NOT automatically buy or sell stocks.
